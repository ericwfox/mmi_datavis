# mmi_datavis

This repository contains an R markdown report on visualizing and mapping EPA stream condition data (sampled MMI scores) from the 2009/09 National Rivers and Streams Assessment.  In R, I used the `ggplot2` package to create the graphics.  In particular, the report provides an example of plotting over 1 million MMI predictions on a map of the conterminous USA. 

The content in the repository is for demonstration and educational purposes only.
